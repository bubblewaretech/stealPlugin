# stealPlugin
RPGMaker MV plugin to allow a character to steal.  Note this steals items that have been put on the character as 'drops' and will then 'clear' those drops so you dont get two items.

## TODO 
-It steals from random enemy since i have issues getting selected one.
-I'd like to add some random luck multiplier but not yet.
